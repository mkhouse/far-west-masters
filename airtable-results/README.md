# Starting a new season
1. Duplicate the previous season's Airtable base without duplicating the records
  * if you need access to the base, contact Melissa, the owner of this repository
2. Copy the Class list from the previous season's base into the Class list of new season's base
  * you may need to unlock the field in the class list to do this, but be sure to lock it again
3. Rename the race tables to match the new season, deleting or adding new tables as needed
4. Rename and relink the link, lookup and rollup fields for each race in the Overall Standings table so there's a set of fields for each race
5. Edit the Class points field in the Overall Standings table to add together the Class points fields for each of the races

# Test race
- You can use the Test race table to test importing and overall standings
- For overall standings, temporarily add link, lookup and rollup fields for the test race to the Overall Standings table
  - Be sure to add these fields to Overall Standings before you import the test race, otherwise the overall rankings won't update properly
- To run the test results
  - Paste sample results into the Import table
  - Fill in Test race as the race in the first row of the import table
  - Check Import table now to start the import
