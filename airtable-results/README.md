# Starting a new season
1. Duplicate the previous season's Airtable base without duplicating the records
  * if you need access to the base, contact Melissa, the owner of this repository
3. Copy the Class list from the previous season's base into the new season's base
  * you may need to unlock the field in the class list to do this, but be sure to lock it again)
4. Rename the race tables to match the new season, deleting or adding new tables as needed
5. Rename and relink the link, lookup and rollup fields for each race in the Overall Standings table so there's a set of fields for each race
