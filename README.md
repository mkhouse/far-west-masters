## Squarespace process notes
### Draft content: Announcements
* In the not linked  section of the website pages list, there's a page called DRAFTS: Announcements
  * use this to draft announcements and give to others to review
  * when ready to post, copy the announcement from the drafts page and paste into the main announcments page
* It's also possible to duplicate the entire homepage and draft announcements, then paste all of the announcments text back in, but doing one at a time is likely easier

### Draft content: Other pages
Either make a duplicate of the page and edit it, then copy into the main page, or swap out the pages.

### Backup content for future reference
Add to the backups folder in github
Options:
1. Take a screenshot and add it to the backups folder in github
2. Start a new text file in the backups folder in github and paste content in
3. Start a new text file in the bgackups folder in github and explain the process and needs
